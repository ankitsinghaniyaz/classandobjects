      <description>I did another post on how every time I install Postgres it&amp;rsquo;s a pain. Jus that you don&amp;rsquo;t think that MySQL is any easy. I&amp;rsquo;m noting down my struggles just as I tried setting up another Rails project which used MySQL.
System Specification  Ubuntu 20.04 MySQL 8+  NOTE: This is the version of Ubuntu Linux I&amp;rsquo;m testing it with. Ubuntu is my primary OS. This should work on other Ubuntu versions without any change.</description>

      <description>This is no beginner stuff! Every time I have to do a fresh install of Postgresql and make it work with Ruby on Rails. It is a pain in the ass. I made up my mind that this is going to be the last time I will have trouble doing this. So here we go with every minute details.

      <description>I first came across the notion of remote work when I was in college. I&amp;rsquo;m neither an extrovert not a complete introvert but somewhere in the middle. Right away I knew that remote work is for me and I want to do it. Even when I tried, it was not very easy to land a paid remote job. I had to do a full-time office for the first 20 months of my career and remote work clicked for me when I was going through the worst phase of my personal and professional life.</description>

      <description>I can never emphasise enough on how Vue makes my life easy but I definitely want to work more in Vue if I&amp;rsquo;m doing frontend development. One issue that I face when building Vue applications using single file components(SFC) is about sharing the common style across components. There is no easy way to do this and most of you will be fine doing a copy paste of the styles across the components.</description>

      <description>When learning Rails we all learn about generators. I still remember when I saw it for the first time. I just fell in love with it. Writing a single command can create useful files and directories for me. Until recently I never had a chance to create a generator. Yesterday I did a blog on using Vue.js with Rails and I saw that I had to create a few files every time I wanted to add Vue to a view.</description>

      <description>Vue.js is awesome. I&amp;rsquo;m telling this after having used React for more than a year in production software. I have written about my experience creating React SPA here. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t tried Vue yet, I highly recommend giving it a try. The developer experience is at the center. In this guide, we will see how to add Vue to a Rails project. So let&amp;rsquo;s get rolling.
In this post, we are going to migrate our devise signup page to use Vue.</description>

      <description>Recently I have been dreaming and talking a lot about methods. Here are few cool things which I discovered on my way to get better at Ruby. I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about different ways in which we can pass parameters to a method. Continue to find out how many of them did you knew already. You can read my difference between class methods and instance methods for some more fun.
The common method def full_name(first, last) &amp;#34;#{first}#{last}&amp;#34; end full_name(&amp;#39;sam&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;smith&amp;#39;) =&amp;gt; &amp;#34;sam smith&amp;#34; Named parameters def parse(name: &amp;#39;Jhon&amp;#39;, hero: &amp;#39;superman&amp;#39;) &amp;#34;I am #{name}, the #{hero}&amp;#34; end parse =&amp;gt; &amp;#34;I am Jhon, the superman&amp;#34; parse(name: &amp;#39;Harry Potter&amp;#39;, hero: &amp;#39;wizard&amp;#39;) =&amp;gt; &amp;#34;I am Harry Potter, the wizard&amp;#34; parse(name: &amp;#39;Luffy&amp;#39;, food: &amp;#39;meat&amp;#39;) # ArgumentError: unknown keyword: food Any number of unnamed parameters def attributes(*args) args.</description>

      <description>Though this is a very simple concept. In my early days of using Ruby, I was always confused about which one to use when and why. I came up with the following way to identify if a method should be a class method or an instance method. I hope this will help you also clear the confusion.
Class Method I think of class methods like function which is going to deal with a collection of Object.</description>

      <description>Rails is awesome, agreed? Everyone understood that JavaScript is coming huge and there has to be a community-specific way to integrate React, Angular or Vue with a rails project.
There have been partial successful attempts like like react-rails gem, react-on-rails, webpack-rails, etc to help user bring JS in. Still, they all lacked somewhere. So here comes all new Rails 5.1 with webpack and yarn integrated.
You don&amp;rsquo;t need to wait for 5.</description>

      <description>Managing rails version on local computer can be a pain. We mostly use rbenv and rvm to manage the ruby version. But it gets difficult to manange version of each gem. In todays world you will want to use docker to control you complete environment. Still, there are cases when you want to try out a version of rails, so here is how you can do that.

      <title>The zen of form validation (React)</title>

      <description>Form validation is complex! With react, it gets even more complicated. In the traditional web, there are inputs and we specify the type, max, min, etc which are validated when the user submits the form. In a slightly more UX focused app you will use jQuery and it&amp;rsquo;s plugin to give the feedback as user types and interacts with the system. You can see all types of validations happening throughout the web and here are my conclusion after doing some research.</description>

      <description>If you are planning to create a single page app maybe you have heard people recommending React as an option. React is amazing and I am currently using React in almost all the projects. As you may have also heard that React is just the view layer so that means you will have to make choices. The choice about the state management, styling, routing, app structure, naming conventions and much more.</description>

      <description>As a software enthusiast, there is nothing which I love more than new technology. I keep my eyes open for phones, laptops and editors. Yes, you got it right. A programmer spends most of his time looking at the screen and from that most of the time staring at the jumble of words known as code. I like fast, good looking and easy to use editors. According to me Sublime Text, Atom and Visual Studio Code are the best options right now.</description>

      <description>Android toolbar is a neat functionality which replaces the old Actionbar. If you want to create a traditional looking, top positioned toolbar then this article is not for you. If you are looking for something in the line of Google plus bottom bar and have the ability to customize it then you should keep reading. Here are few screenshots to demonstrate what I mean.
The Layout Few thing to know before we start, I will not use menu options, it makes the toolbar creation easier but takes away the power to customize.</description>

Install react_on_rails gem To make mobx functional with rails, I had to drop react-rails gem and adopt the react_on_rails gem. Setting it up is cumbersome in the beginning but it pays off well in the long run.</description>

You may be either starting your career or are a seasoned developer, the chances are too likely that you are having trouble hitting the right balance between language and logical skills. In this article, I will try to find out what is the right balance to keep levelling up our programming skills.
In the current education system, most of the times, we tend to focus too much on the logical aspect of the programming.</description>

 R is good at one thing, analysis. Until now it was sufficient on its own, with its library base, but now the need have changed. We want interactive visualization and JavaScript is ahead in the race. Thanks to this man, Ramnath Vaidya, who created a wonderful library called rCharts that brings JavaScript&amp;rsquo;s graphics into R. As you are reading this you must be familiar with plot and ggplot in R.</description>

So, lets get started.

      <description>This post shows, how you can easily host your static website on Github. We are using Hugo static site generator. You can use anything similar.
Initial Setup I believe that you already have setup your hugo project, refer the link in case you want to start a project. Then open your config.toml file and modify the baseUrl as:
baseurl = &amp;quot;http://{username}.github.io/&amp;quot;
replace {username} with your username.
Repository for Project Files This step is not mandatory, but still you want to do this.</description>
