      <description>Vue.js is awesome. I&amp;rsquo;m telling this after having used React for more than a year in production software. I have written about my experience creating React SPA here. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t tried Vue yet, I highly recommend giving it a try. The developer experience is at the center. In this guide, we will see how to add Vue to a Rails project. So let&amp;rsquo;s get rolling.
In this post, we are going to migrate our devise signup page to use Vue.</description>

      <description>Rails is awesome, agreed? Everyone understood that JavaScript is coming huge and there has to be a community-specific way to integrate React, Angular or Vue with a rails project.
There have been partial successful attempts like like react-rails gem, react-on-rails, webpack-rails, etc to help user bring JS in. Still, they all lacked somewhere. So here comes all new Rails 5.1 with webpack and yarn integrated.
You don&amp;rsquo;t need to wait for 5.</description>

      <description>Form validation is complex! With react, it gets even more complicated. In the traditional web, there are inputs and we specify the type, max, min, etc which are validated when the user submits the form. In a slightly more UX focused app you will use jQuery and it&amp;rsquo;s plugin to give the feedback as user types and interacts with the system. You can see all types of validations happening throughout the web and here are my conclusion after doing some research.</description>

      <description>If you are planning to create a single page app maybe you have heard people recommending React as an option. React is amazing and I am currently using React in almost all the projects. As you may have also heard that React is just the view layer so that means you will have to make choices.
