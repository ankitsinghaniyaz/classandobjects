      <description>I may be young, but age is just a number. I have seen life and work. I have been lost and I have been saved. I have travelled from the complete chaos of not knowing where to go and then to the bliss of understanding how everything fits together. I have hopped from language to language and now I understand them all(almost).
I love to code in Python, given how clean, readable and maintainable it looks.</description>
