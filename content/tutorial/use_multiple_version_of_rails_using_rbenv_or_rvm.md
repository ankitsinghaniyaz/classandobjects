Managing rails version on local computer can be a pain. We mostly use `rbenv` and `rvm` to manage the `ruby` version. But it gets difficult to manange version of each gem. In todays world you will want to use [docker](https://www.docker.com/) to control you complete environment. Still, there are cases when you want to try out a version of rails, so here is how you can do that.
