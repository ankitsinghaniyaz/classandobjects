As a software enthusiast, there is nothing which I love more than new technology. I keep my eyes open for phones, laptops and editors. Yes, you got it right. A programmer spends most of his time looking at the screen and from that most of the time staring at the jumble of words known as code. I like fast, good looking and easy to use editors. According to me Sublime Text, Atom and Visual Studio Code are the best options right now. I have used all of them in real world projects and here are my reviews.

## Sublime Text

The oldest in the guild yet the fastest. You won't be disappointed if you picked up this time tasted editor. I have used sublime the longest and I am always happy to use it. Though, I have faced few issues with linting and other extensions.

Pros:

- Fast
- Light
- Good Theme Support

Cons:

- Linting
- Git tools
- Debugging


## Atom

This editor is my favourite currently and I use this one mostly. It is made by GitHub and has a plethora of extension that makes it really useful.

Pros:

- Best Looking
- Highly Customizable
- Linting

Cons:

- Slower than Sublime
- No VS Code like Git visual integration


## VS Code

This is the youngest editor here, it is also based on the same `electron` core used in Atom. It has an amazing GitHub Interactive tool that makes life very easy. It also supports easy debugging for people into JavaScript.

Pros:

- Amazing Git Tool
- Debugging Support
- Fast

Cons:

- Bad Theme
- The current version has a bug which doesn't match tags

## Conclusion

I feel that all these options are amazing. It is a matter of personal taste than anything else. I find my comfort with Atom, but I do remember the speed of Sublime and amazing git tool from VS Code. Feel free to let me know if I missed something by commenting below. Thanks for reading...
