I may be young, but age is just a number. I have seen life and work. I have been lost and I have been saved. I have travelled from the complete chaos of not knowing where to go and then to the bliss of understanding how everything fits together. I have hopped from language to language and now I understand them all(almost).

I love to code in Python, given how clean, readable and maintainable it looks. In my professional work I use Ruby on Rails as my mode of transport and React js as my way to interact. I have always wondered how can one land a freelance job and then work less and enjoy more. I am a firm believer that workplace can never be as comfortable as home, the smell of my table, my fire(I'll get one) and everything else. They just save you a lot of energy. You do not have to travel, time saved. You can use your resources and of course, earn better. I am also a budding traveller, I want to explore places and learn more, and of course, this includes technology. Freelancing empowers me in both the ways, financially and physically.

[Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/web) is an awesome platform, indeed the best one for freelancing. If given, I would love to explore amazing people, exciting job and gorgeous lifestyle.
